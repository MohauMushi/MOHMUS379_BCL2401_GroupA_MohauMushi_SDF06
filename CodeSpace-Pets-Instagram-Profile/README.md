## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project, I recreated a simplified version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.


### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: At the start of the project, i was not confident that i can completed ot pull this project off, the use of Flexbox and Grid was really challenging, but i can say that i will get there with more practice and be confident in using Flexbox and Grids. I did learn so much, 
- **Responsive Design**: I manage to implement the media queries so that my page can look fine in desktops and mobile screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I did manage to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.


#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:The resizing for smaller screens was a little bit challenging, and the using media queries, was a challenge also, but i tried to make it work. I had to look at youtube to see how to work through it.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: For the hover effect i reseached and looked at some youtube videos and i implemented, what the videos was doing so that i can make it work, and i did struggle and had to rewatch the videos again, still i get it right.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I really want to learn more of the advanced css and the animation part, so that i can be more experienced on advanced css and amnimation. I would like to come back to this project and do major improvements.
- **Code Optimization**: My code it does work for the project, but i still need to improve my choices of code and implimenting the code in the projects that i do.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I did look online for some old instagram layout and i referenced it from the layout. But in the future i wish, to improve my designs or come up with creative designs for the future projects that i will be doing.
